This widget can display a random recent VSCO post from a specified user (URL passed as a widget parameter). 

### Setup
Setup the widget parameter with the profile URL you want to see posts from.

A feature exists to show only the latest photo, so you know if the photo changes, the user has posted something new. To set this up, include "|latest" at the end of the profile URL passed as the widget parameter.

### Future Updates
The widget has a built-in update function included. This is just in case the widget code needs to be updated. If you see this "Update Available!" text under the date, you can simply run the script in the Scriptable app, then you'll be prompted with the changes.

As always, it's your choice to update or not. 

Of course it is recommended :)
